// Use the Remove() and Replace() methods

/*

In the previous unit, we learned how to locate the position of a character or string within another string. We used the position to extract a sub string.
Sometimes, we'll need to modify the contents of the string, removing or replacing characters. While we could do this with the tools we already know, it requires a bit of temporarily storing and stitching strings back together. Fortunately, the string data type has additional built-in methods for these specialized scenarios.
*/

// Exercise - Use the Remove() and Replace() methods
// In this exercise, we'll remove characters from a string using the Remove() method and replace characters using the Replace() method.
// STEP 1 - WRITE CODE TO REMOVE CHARACTERS IN SPECIFIC LOCATIONS FROM A STRING

/*
You would typically use Remove() when there's a standard and consistent position of the characters you want to remove from the string.
Sometimes, data stored in older files is fixed length, where character positions are allocated for certain fields of information. In this first step of our exercise, we have such a fictitious record of information. The first five digits represent a customer identification number. The next 20 digits contain a customer's name. The next six positions represent the customer's latest invoice amount, and the last three positions represent the number of items ordered on that invoice.
Perhaps we need to remove the customer's name to format the data so that it can be sent to a separate process. Since we know the exact position and length of the user's name, we can easily remove it using the Remove() method.
Comment out or delete all of the code in the .NET Editor. Then, write code in the .NET Editor so that it matches the following code listing.
*/

string data = "12345John Smith          5000  3  ";
string updatedData = data.Remove(5, 20);
Console.WriteLine(updatedData);
When you run the code, you'll see the follow output.
Output

123455000  3  
// The Remove() method works similarly to the Substring() method. You supply a starting position and the length to remove those characters from the string.

// STEP 2 - WRITE CODE TO REMOVE CHARACTERS NO MATTER WHERE THEY APPEAR IN A STRING

// You would use the Replace() method when you must replace one or more characters with a different character (or no character). The Replace() method is different from the other methods we've used so far inasmuch as it will replace every instance of the given characters, not just the first or last instance.
	// Delete the code from step 1, and add the code from the following listing.

string message = "This--is--ex-amp-le--da-ta";
message = message.Replace("--", " ");
message = message.Replace("-", "");
Console.WriteLine(message);
// When you run the code, you should see the following output.

 This is example data
// Here we used the Replace() method twice. The first time we replaced the string -- with an empty space. The second time we replaced the string - with an empty string, which completely removes the character from the string.
// 					Recap
// Here's the most important things to remember from this unit:
	// The Remove() method works like the Substring() method, except that it deletes the specified characters in the string.
	// The Replace() method swaps all instances of a string with a new string.
